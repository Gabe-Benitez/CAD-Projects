# CAD-Projects
The purpose of the projects created in this Google folder was to learn concepts of computer-aided design in 2-diemsions and 3-dimensions. In this course, I practiced creating advanced parts using extrusions, surfaces, and equating driven sketches. Additionally, I worked on forming assemblies, and sub-assemblies, for motion analysis.

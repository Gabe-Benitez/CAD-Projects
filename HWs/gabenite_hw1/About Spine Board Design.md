The EMS backboard I designed in Solidworks was based off the backboard image provided in Homework 1 and the Ferno Millennia backboard. The design included 8 round handles with the top handles closest to the head of the board being shaped in a semicircle. The length of the board was 72 inches because the average height for a male is about 69 inches, so having the board 3 inches longer will allow the average male and anyone shorter to fit on the board. The width of the backboard was designed to be a maximum of 20 inches to fit people with large chest sizes. The EMS backboard design was extruded to make the board have a thickness of 2 inches.

The focus of this project was to create a Spine Board (Medial backboard) with the following REQUIREMENTS:

You must design and model your own version of a backboard. You may choose to copy what is already
out there (Google is your friend), or you may choose to design one yourself.
Your backboard design should be comparable to what’s out there. It should not be very tiny, or too
large. It should not be thin and flimsy, or thick and bulky.
Come up with a design that is based on functional requirements. These are lists of features that will be
included in your design for specific purposes. For example:
 Having rounded handles along the sides of the backboard making it easier for EMT’s to grip.
Sharp square handles are bulky and uncomfortable to hold on to
 The height of the board is 72 inches because the average male in the US is 70 inches tall.
These functional requirements help to inform our decisions about the physical design.
Your design should satisfy these functional requirements:
1. Minimum dimensions:
a. At least 72” long
b. At least 1.5” thick
c. 16” – 20” wide
2. Should be designed to allow for easy carrying by EMS

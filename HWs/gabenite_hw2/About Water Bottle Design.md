This water bottle was designed to be lightweight with the ability to hold about 32 fl. oz for long walks or hikes. Also, the type of plastic used for the bottle was PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) because this is the most common type of plastic used to hold portable water since its both strong and light. The top of the bottle has threads for the lid of the bottle as well as a little bit of space to add a ring that can be attached to the lid of the bottle, so it can dangle from the bottle once its open. The bottle itself weighs 0.32 lbs., and the total weight of the bottle plus water filled up to the very top would be 2.64 lbs.
